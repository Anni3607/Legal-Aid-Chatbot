# NyaySathi – Legal Aid Chatbot

## Overview  
NyaySathi is a beginner-friendly legal aid chatbot designed to provide quick answers to common legal questions in India. It is based on a pre-built knowledge base of more than 100 frequently asked questions, covering areas such as criminal law, consumer protection, property disputes, family law, labor rights, cybercrime, and more.  

The chatbot works as a retrieval-based system: it compares the user’s query with stored questions and provides the closest possible answer. The application is built in Python and deployed using Streamlit, making it easy to access from any device.
